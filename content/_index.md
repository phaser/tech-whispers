I'm Cristian, a software engineer based in Bucharest, Romania! I’ve been writing software for close to two decades, mostly on systems that break in ways tutorials don’t cover.

I’ve worked across very different domains: games, networking tools, data-heavy applications, developer platforms, and large-scale automation on macOS, Linux, and Windows. These days my work sits at the intersection of infrastructure, tooling, and reliability: build systems, CI/CD, cross-environment orchestration, and the glue code that makes complex systems behave consistently.
