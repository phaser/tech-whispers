## Terminal tools

* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
* [nvim via lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
* [vim](https://www.vim.org/) - when I'm in a hurry and don't have time to setup lazyvim

### Oh My Themes

These themes are incredibly convenient. I want my terminal to look good and be functional, but I prefer not to spend much time setting it up when starting on a new machine. The "Oh My *" themes offer attractive defaults and make customization easy, being an excellent starting point for any setup.

* [Oh my tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)
* [Oh my bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash)
* [Oh my posh](https://ohmypo.sh/)
* [Oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

### Enhancers

* [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) is a diff pager that supports syntax highlighting
* [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is cat with syntax highlighting
