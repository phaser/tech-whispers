## Terminal tools

### Oh My Themes

These themes are incredibly convenient. I want my terminal to look good and be functional, but I prefer not to spend much time setting it up when starting on a new machine. The "Oh My *" themes offer attractive defaults and make customization easy, being an excellent starting point for any setup.
